# Bowling scoring library

This was done for a code test part of an interview.

> ### Problem statement:
> Write a program that takes as input an array of integers representing a
  complete 10-pin bowling game, where each int represents the number of pins
  knocked down by a single roll, and outputs the score for the game. We write
  code primarily in Scala using the functional programming paradigm, but you
  are welcome to use the language and design strategy of your choice.
> ### Deliverables:
> Please include the code for the program in a git repository including all
  docs, tests and anything needed to build your code (e.g. a Makefile if you
  write it in C). Also include instructions on how to run it and tell us
  what the dependencies are if they need to be installed manually.

> Things we care about when looking at your code:
>
>  * It solves the problem
>  * Correctness / edge case handling
>  * Code design / simplicity and clarity
>  * Error handling
>  * Test quality and expressiveness
>  * Documentation
